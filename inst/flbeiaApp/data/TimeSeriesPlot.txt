Time series plots show the evolution of indicators over time. The indicator time series in each scenario is
drawn with a different color. Confidence intervals can also be added marking the corresponding option. 
Several indicators and stock, fleets or metiers (depending on the case) can be selected simultaneously and
they are plotted in different facets.
