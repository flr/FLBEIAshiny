Spider plots allow to compare the (median) value of an indicator along a big set of scenarios for a certain year. 
The scenarios correspond with the edges of the web. The value is standardized comparing the value in one year 
with a base year (year option) or with a base scenario (scenario option). Thus, the dashed black line correspond with 
the unit circle, lines outside the circle represent values higher than in the base year or scenario and 
those inside the circle represent lower values. The variables used to draw lines 
and facets can be exchange, so lines can correspond with stock or fleets (depending on the case) and facets with
indicators or the other way around.
