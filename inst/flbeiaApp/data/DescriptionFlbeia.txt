This is a simulation toolbox implemented as an R library 
which facilitates the development of bio-economic impact assessments 
of fisheries management strategies. It is built under a management 
strategy evaluation framework using FLR libraries. The simulation is 
divided in two worlds, the operating model (OM, the real world) and 
the management procedure model (MPM, the perceived world).
