The summary plot tries to summarize, for an specific scenario, the biological and  economic results in a single plot. 
Each quadrant represent one indicator SSB (top-left), F (top-right), Gross Surplus (bottom-left),
Capacity (bottom-right). The values of those incators a certain year (or the mean over a range of years) are
compared with the values in a reference year. The black circle correspond with the unit circle, so 
lines outside the circle represent values higher than in the reference year and those inside the circle represent lower values.
Stocks and fleets are represented with different colors.
